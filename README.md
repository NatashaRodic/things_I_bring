## üìù Description

 </div>

Things I Bring - assists individuals in packing for their travels. With just a few inputs like your destination, date, and style, the app generates a complete list of everything you need for your trip. It even uses weather data to suggest appropriate clothing and calculates the number of items you'll need based on the length of your stay. The list is divided into two categories: clothing/items and essential items and features checkboxes so you can keep track of what you've already packed.
