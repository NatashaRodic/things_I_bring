## üìù Description

 </div>

Things I Bring - assists individuals in packing for their travels. With just a few inputs like your destination, date, and style, the app generates a complete list of everything you need for your trip. It even uses weather data to suggest appropriate clothing and calculates the number of items you'll need based on the length of your stay. The list is divided into two categories: clothing/items and essential items and features checkboxes so you can keep track of what you've already packed.

## Getting started [ ‚ñ∂Ô∏è](https://natasharodic.github.io/mastermind/)

1. Pick Color Combination: Choose four colors from the sidebar to begin.

2. Check Your Guess: Click "Check" to see if your combination matches the winning one.

3. Get Feedback: Receive feedback with red and white pegs.
   Red pegs indicate correct color and position.
   White pegs mean correct color but wrong position.
   No pegs mean no correct guesses.

4. Keep trying: Guess up to ten times to win, or continue trying until you succeed within ten attempts. If you reach the maximum of ten guesses without guessing the combination, you lose.
